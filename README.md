# journeyrango
django project 

the 5 most viewed pages;
the five most rango’ed categories; and
some way for visitors to browse or search through categories.

the category name, the number of visits, the number of likes;
along with the list of associated pages in that category (showing the page’s title and linking to its url); and.
some search functionality (via Bing’s Search API) to find other pages that can be linked to this category.

Only registered users will be able to search and add pages to categories. And so, visitors to the site should be able to register for an account.
